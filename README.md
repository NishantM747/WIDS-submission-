Saw the structure and the logic with which the code was implemented in the video, and tried to create the same thing from scratch. Debugging sadly took much longer than expected and i had to resort to using AI to create AI :(. 
Anyways i think its working as its supposed to right now, tho my output still looks a little different than the video showed.
